## PyCBC: Python Software to Study Gravitational Waves ##
PyCBC is software developed by a collaboration of LIGO, Virgo, and independent scientists. It is open source and freely available. We use PyCBC in the detection of gravitational waves from binary mergers such as GW150914. These examples explore how to analyze gravitational wave data, how we find potential signals, and learn about them.

These notebooks are available to view, download, or run in interactive sessions.
